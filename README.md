We add the above libraries into pupspec.yaml. Then we log into Firebase and add our project. We do cloud transactions with the help of Firebase. We do the state management part with the Provider package.

When our application opens, a blank screen welcomes us. We can use the page refresh and video add buttons from the bottom. Thanks to the edit button with the pen icon, we choose a video from our gallery. The video comes to us in the form of 1-second pictures, frame by frame. You can edit these images by clicking on them. When we approve the edited image, we upload the changes to Firebase by clicking the upload icon on the FloatActionButton.
